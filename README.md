# MLUCM
## Description 
1D **Multi-Layer Urban Canopy Model**  - solving the drag and vertical diffusion in a column for a neutral case. This model is based on Santiago and Martilli 2010 and modified by Nazarian et al. 2019 (forthcoming) using the Large Eddy Simulation results. 

## Motivations
1) Improving the parameterization of turbulent length scale by employing a more accurate turbulence model of atmospheric flow (LES vs RANS). 
2) Integrating the parameterization of dispersive stress in the 1D model.  
3) updating the parameterization of turbulent and dissipation length scales.
