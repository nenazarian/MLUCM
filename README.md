# MLUCM
## Description 
1D **Multi-Layer Urban Canopy Model**  - solving the drag and vertical diffusion in a column for a neutral case. This model is based on Santiago and Martilli 2010 and modified by Nazarian et al. 2017 (fortcoming) using the Large Eddy Simulation results. 

## Motivations
1) Improving the parameterization of turbulent length scale by employing a more accurate turbulence model of atmospheric flow (LES vs RANS). 
2) Integrating the parameterization of dispersive stress in the 1D model
