**Concerns and Limitations - specification of the 1D model**
--------------------------------------------------
1) The model is more sensitive to the simulation setups such as domain height and the Cmu value, than detailed Length scale and drag
coefficients introduced based on the LES results.

2) With the current forcing setup (pressure gradient), domain height of the 1D model should be at least 7 H (similar to the domain height
of LES) to be able to capture the LES results. This is much higher than the usual domain height of 1D model when used in the BEP-tree or
integrated in WRF (often 2-3H).

3) In all cases, the TKE value above building the building height is underestimated, and the surface TKE value is not captured correctly.
Mauree et al 2017 proposed a correction for the surface TKE value that can potentially be used in the 1D model as well.

4) Dispersive TKE not included in the k equation of the 1D model (\tilde{k}\tilde{w})

5) The length scale calculated based on LES reaches zero at the top boundary (since u'w'(nz)=0), while in RANS the length scale is monotonically increasing with height. Additionally, the variability of the length scale within the building height is not introduced (averaged Ck.LkM within the building canyon parameterized). 
--------------------------------------------------
6) FUTURE CONSIDERATIONS: The 1D model does not distinguish between the staggered and aligned configuration, while Cdeq variation and Lk are shown to be very different (in both trend and magnitude) for different configurations.

7) FUTURE CONSIDERATIONS:The variability of wind direction not integrated in the 1D model


--------------------------------------------------
**Concerns/Suggestions - Code**
--------------------------------------------------
1) Hard-coded parameters (including cmu, nlp, nzm, and nzc) are very error-prone.
**Changing the hard-coded description of domain grid number (nzm) and number of layers within the canopy (nzc) requires changing all reals 
based on nzm to be changed according to the following
Real, allocatable, dimension(:) :: dlk

2) Suggest to add the units in the specification of the input file, and add inputs with the namelist format.
