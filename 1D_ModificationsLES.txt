**Major modifications to the MLUCM code**
----------------------------
1) Parameterization of Lk updated:
- The length scale is parameterized based on the mixing length scale instead of the dissipation length scale. 
- Ck and Ceps (constants for the k-l scheme) are included in the parameterization (Ck.Lk and similarly Leps/Ceps are parameterized). 
- The parameterization of the mixing length scale is updated to include the dispersive stress. 
- Above the building height: **2nd degree polynomial** parameterization as a function of plan area density (Lp) introduced for the mixing length scale. 
- Below the building height: mixing length scale parameterized as a function of Lp plan area density (4th order polynomial!)

2) Parameterization of drag coefficient (Cdeq) 
- 2nd order polynomial fit introduced (same in the x and y directions) based on **Lp** (and not Lf_x and Lf_y)  

3) In subroutine 'drag_length':
- input parameters 'bx,by,wx,wy' are passed on (previously hard-coded in the subrounite). 
- by=bx assumption is taken out
